# Contents
  *  ## Machine Learning
     * [Logistic Regression - Breat Cancer ](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Breat_Cancer.ipynb): logistc regression is a supervised learning classification algorithm use to predict the probability of a target varible. The nature of target or dependet variable is dichotomous, which means there would be only two possible classes
       
     * [k-nearest neighbors (KNN) -  biology](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Iris%20KNN.ipynb) algorithm is a simple, supervise that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.The number of nearest neighbours to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified is denoted by the symbol ‘K’.
     
     * [Neural Network (NNs) -  biology](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Neural_Network_Irises_.ipynb) is a network or circuit of biological neurons,or in a modern sense,an artificial neural network.
     
     * [K-means clustering -  biology](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/K-mean%20Iris%20(unsupervised).ipynb) is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.
     * [ TfidfVectorizer - smiple text or words detector](https://github.com/doowilliams/data_science_poortfolio/blob/main/Building_a_simple_NLP_Spam_and_Harm_Dectector.ipynb) Tfidfvectorizer for text classification · Term Frequency: Number of time a word appears in a text documen
